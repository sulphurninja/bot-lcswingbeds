const FAQ_DATA = `
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q: Can I hang my swing from 2 points instead of 4?
A: Yes, you can hang your swing bed from 2 points instead of 4, but always hang your swing from 4 points when possible. Remember that the weight limit will only be 640 pounds with a 2-point ceiling connection. With a 4-point ceiling connection, your weight limit would be 1,280 pounds. Each of our ceiling hooks is rated for 320 pounds.

Another consideration is your swing size. If you purchase a larger swing, full-size or above, there may be a tipping factor to adjust or work around when hanging from 2 points only. A 2-point ceiling connection equals more "swing" to your swing. Please leave enough room behind the swing to accommodate the movement.

Q: Where can I see your swing beds?
A: We have a workshop in Charleston, South Carolina, where we handcraft our swing beds; however, the best way to see our finished beds is right here on our website. If you're in the area and would like to visit our workshop, please email us at relax@lcswingbeds.com to request an appointment.

Q: Do you accept custom swing bed orders?
A: We accept custom swing bed orders on a case-by-case basis. Please note that custom orders may be subject to increased production time as well as additional costs. If you have a request or have seen a bed you'd like us to recreate, send us a message through our contact form or email us at relax@lcswingbeds.com. A member of our team will get back to you.

Q: Do you offer designer discounts?
A: Yes! We love working with designers, dealers, and everyone in between. If you are interested in learning more about pricing incentives and details for your company, please send us an email. We do not offer credit terms.

Q: Do you offer on-site consultation?
A: We do not offer on-site consultation; however, if you measure your porch (width by depth) and send us photos along with those measurements at relax@lcswingbeds.com, we will gladly consult with you by email or phone.

Q: Where can you ship swing beds and accessories?
A: We currently ship swing beds and accessories within the contiguous Continental United States. This does not include Hawaii, Alaska, or territories in the Caribbean. Moreover, we are unable to ship to other countries.

Q: How do I adjust the height of my swing bed after the rope has settled?
A: A 1-inch to 1.5-inch rope may settle and stretch more over time than a .75-inch rope, meaning you may need to adjust your swing bed periodically. To adjust it, lift up on both sides of the swing and place a 5-gallon bucket or other sturdy support underneath your swing bed's right and left sides. Once the swing's weight is safely and fully supported by something other than the rope, un-tie each knot, pull the rope tight, and re-tie each knot at a higher location than before. After all four knots are re-tied, you can lift up on each side of the bed swing, remove the supports, and let the swing hang freely. To tighten the knots further, press down on each side of the swing bed until the knots are tight and the bed is level.

Q: How long will it take for my bed swing and cushions to arrive?
A: Our current lead time for delivery is 8-10 weeks for bed swings and 4-6 weeks for cushions. While we do our absolute best to stay on track, situations can occur which may slightly affect this timeline. Keep in mind the cushions will arrive separately from the swing, as they are sewn off-site at another facility, free of sawdust.

We are able to expedite both swings and cushions for an additional fee.

HOLDING FEE: If you are not ready for your swing after the current lead time has passed and your swing is ready to ship, we may charge a holding fee of $50/week. We have a very small warehouse, so it is difficult for us to hold a swing after the current lead time has passed. We have an excess of 100 orders in progress at any given time, so please consider these timelines if your home is under construction.

`;

const CUSHION_CARE_GUIDE = `
CUSHION CARE & OUTDOOR UPHOLSTERY INSTRUCTIONS:

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Brush off loose dirt regularly and treat spills as soon as they happen
- Always rinse thoroughly after cleaning to remove soap or cleaner residue
- Air dry only
- Refrain from machine washing as it can damage the stitching - hand/spot clean only

QUICK SPILL RESPONSE (New Spills):
1. Blot, don't rub liquid with a clean, dry cloth
2. For oil-based spills, sprinkle an absorbent (e.g., cornstarch), let it draw out the oil, then lift with a straight edge
3. Spray a mild soap + water solution (see ratios below)
4. Rinse completely
5. Air dry

REMOVABLE CUSHION COVERS:

Hand Washing:
- Mix 1/4 cup mild soap per 1 gallon (3.8 L) lukewarm water
- Soak the cover, then lightly agitate with a sponge or very soft brush
- Rinse thoroughly until water runs clear
- Air dry

Machine Washing (check with furniture maker before removing covers):
- Close all zippers
- Cold water, delicate cycle, normal amount of mild laundry detergent
- For severe mold/mildew: add 1 cup household bleach to the wash
- Air dry (no heat)

NON-REMOVABLE CUSHIONS:
- Mix 1/4 cup mild soap per 1 gallon lukewarm water
- Apply and gently scrub with a soft bristle brush; allow solution to soak in
- Rinse thoroughly to remove all residue
- Air dry
- For tough, colored stains, use a suitable fabric stain/spot remover following label directions, then rinse and air dry
- Clean seam-to-seam across the entire panel instead of scrubbing in circles to avoid water rings
- Using an extractor/wet-vac after rinsing can help prevent rings and residue

MOLD & MILDEW REMOVAL:
- Mildew doesn't grow on the fabric itself but can grow on dirt left on the surface
- Mix 1 cup bleach + 1/4 cup mild soap per 1 gallon water
- Apply to the entire area (not just the spot) and soak ~15 minutes
- Lightly clean with a sponge/towel/very soft brush
- Rinse thoroughly to remove all soap/bleach
- Air dry
- For severe growth, you may increase bleach proportionally
- Safety: Work in a ventilated area, protect surrounding materials from overspray

OIL-BASED STAINS (Grease, Sunscreen, etc.):
- If residue remains after standard cleaning, apply a degreaser or an oil-stain remover rated for outdoor fabrics
- Rinse thoroughly and air dry

DRYING, WRINKLES & HEAT:
- Air dry only
- If wrinkling occurs, use an iron on synthetic setting (test a small, hidden area first)
- Do not steam and do not use a steamer setting

RETREATING/RE-PROTECTING THE FABRIC (Optional):
- Heavy use and repeated deep cleanings can reduce water/stain repellency
- Clean and fully air dry using the methods above
- Apply a reputable outdoor-fabric protector/repellent in a well-ventilated area, following the product's label

DO'S AND DON'TS:
DO:
- Brush off dust/debris routinely
- Treat spills promptly
- Use mild soap solutions and soft tools
- Rinse completely and air dry
- Test heat/ironing on a hidden area first

DON'T:
- Scrub with hard/abrasive brushes
- Skip the rinse step (residue attracts dirt)
- Use steam or high-heat drying
- Clean only a small circle—go seam-to-seam
- Ignore mildew—treat with the proper bleach solution and rinse well

const QUICK_QA = `
QUICK REFERENCE Q&A:

INSTALLATION & SETUP:
Q: Do you offer installation services?
A: We work with an insured third-party installer who services a 150-mile radius around Charleston. If you are unsure if you fall within that radius, please send an inquiry email to relax@lcswingbeds.com with your delivery address.

Q: What clearance do I need around a swing?
A: Sides & back: 10–24 inches; front: 20–24 inches.

Q: What hanging height should I use?
A: About 15 inches from ground for the swing base; this targets ~24 inches seating height with a 6-inch mattress (adjust on site as needed).

Q: What materials do you recommend for coastal homes?
A: Mahogany/Teak or pine with a marine-grade finish upgrade. Minimize exposed metal in the hanging system.

Q: Should I use chain or rope near the coast?
A: Prefer synthetic rope to limit metal exposure (helps reduce corrosion).

Q: Is natural Manila rope okay in humid/tropical places?
A: Not ideal—it tends to stretch/breathe seasonally.

CUSTOMIZATION & ORDERS:
Q: Can you customize swings to my needs?
A: Yes, within reason. The team can tailor solutions for specific requirements.

Q: Do you build non-swing items?
A: Sometimes. As a custom woodshop, non-swing projects are considered case-by-case (human quote required).

POLICIES:
Q: What's the warranty?
A: 1-year against craftsmanship defects on cushions and swings.

Q: Do you accept returns?
A: No returns are offered.

Q: What should I do if my swing is damaged during shipping?
A: Photograph visible damage before accepting delivery if possible, ask the carrier to note the damage, and contact support with photos and order info.

CUSHION CARE:
Q: A drink just spilled on my outdoor cushion. What's my first move?
A: Blot (don't rub) with a dry cloth, apply mild soap + water, rinse thoroughly, and air dry.

Q: How do I hand-wash removable outdoor cushion covers?
A: Soak in 1/4 cup mild soap per gallon lukewarm water, lightly agitate with a soft brush, rinse completely, air dry.

Q: Can I machine-wash the removable covers?
A: Yes, if the furniture maker says it's okay. Close zippers; wash cold, delicate, normal detergent; air dry. For severe mildew, add 1 cup bleach.

Q: How do I clean non-removable outdoor cushions?
A: Apply 1/4 cup mild soap per gallon solution, gently brush, allow to soak, rinse thoroughly, air dry. Clean seam-to-seam to avoid rings.

Q: What's the ratio for removing mold/mildew?
A: 1 cup bleach + 1/4 cup mild soap per 1 gallon water; soak ~15 min, gently clean, rinse thoroughly, air dry. Increase bleach if needed.

Q: Can I use a degreaser for oily stains?
A: Yes—use a fabric-safe degreaser/oil-stain remover, then rinse thoroughly and air dry.

Q: Why do I get water rings?
A: Cleaning in small circles leaves edge residue. Clean entire panels seam-to-seam and consider an extractor/wet-vac after rinsing.

Q: Can I put cushions in the dryer or use steam?
A: No. Air dry only; avoid steam.

Q: Can I iron the fabric?
A: Yes, on synthetic setting only—test a hidden area first.

Q: When should I re-apply a fabric protector?
A: After repeated deep cleanings or years of exposure. Clean and fully dry first, then apply a reputable outdoor-fabric protector per label.
